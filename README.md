What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will 
require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive 
at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to 
solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the 
inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
